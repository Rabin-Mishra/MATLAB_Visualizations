# MATLAB Signal Processing and Analysis Repository

This repository contains MATLAB code developed to analyze and simulate various functions and concepts in signal processing and system analysis. The tasks carried out include exploring impulse, ramp, step, unit signals, Fourier series, aliasing, sampling, circular convolutions, transfer functions, and more.

## Tasks & Concepts Implemented

The following signal processing and analysis tasks have been implemented:

- **Impulse, Ramp, Step, and Unit Signals**: Analysis of basic elementary signals and their properties.
- **Unit Ramp Function**: Visualization and analysis of unit ramp signals and their usage in signal processing.
- **Line Coding**: Implementation of various line coding techniques to encode and decode data.
- **Fourier Series**: Representation of periodic functions as sums of sinusoidal functions using Fourier series.
- **Noisy Sinusoidal Signal**: Generation and analysis of sinusoidal signals with added noise to study signal noise impacts.
- **Aliasing due to Undersampling**: Simulation of aliasing effects when a signal is undersampled.
- **Random Signal Generation**: Generation and analysis of random signals using MATLAB's built-in functions.
- **Circular Convolution**: Implementation of circular convolution to understand signal processing in the frequency domain.
- **Sampling Theorem**: Implementation to demonstrate the sampling theorem and the effects of sampling rates on signals.
- **Transfer Functions**: Analysis and simulation of transfer functions for different systems.

Each task involves MATLAB code and graphical outputs to help students understand the core concepts of signal processing and communication systems.

## MATLAB Setup Required

To run the code and replicate the results in this repository, you will need to set up MATLAB with the following steps:

1. **Install MATLAB**: Download and install the latest version of MATLAB from [MathWorks](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html).
   
2. **MATLAB Toolboxes**: Ensure you have the following toolboxes installed (if not included in your version of MATLAB):
   - **Signal Processing Toolbox**: Required for signal manipulation and Fourier transformations.
   - **Communications System Toolbox**: Useful for tasks like line coding and aliasing simulations.

   You can check and install additional toolboxes via MATLAB's Add-Ons menu.

3. **Running the Code**:
   - Clone this repository:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/Rabin-Mishra/MATLAB_Visualizations
     ```
   - Open MATLAB and navigate to the directory where the code is stored:
     ```matlab
     cd 'path_to_your_directory/matlab-signal-processing'
     ```
   - Run the individual MATLAB scripts for each task by typing the script name in the command window (e.g., `impulse_signal.m`).
